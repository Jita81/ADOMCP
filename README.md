#### For Azure DevOps:
1. Go to [https://dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com)
2. Click your profile picture → Personal Access Tokens
3. Create a new token with "Work Items" permissions
4. Copy the token (it looks like: `6m5o0...`)

#### For GitHub:
1. Go to [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Generate a new token with "repo" and "issues" permissions
3. Copy the token (it looks like: `ghp_...`)

#### For GitLab (Optional):
1. Go to GitLab → Settings → Access Tokens
2. Create a token with "API" permissions
3. Copy the token

### Step 2: Use the Live Tool 🌐
